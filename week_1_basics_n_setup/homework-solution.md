## Week 1 homework solutions

## Question 1
```bash
$ gcloud --version
Google Cloud SDK 407.0.0
bq 2.0.79
core 2022.10.21
gcloud-crc32c 1.0.0
gsutil 5.15
```
## Question 2
```
$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "local"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/google...
- Installing hashicorp/google v4.41.0...
- Installed hashicorp/google v4.41.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the
following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if
you run "terraform apply" now.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

## Question 3

```sql
select count(*) 
from yellow_taxi_trips 
where 
  tpep_pickup_datetime between date('2021-01-15') and date('2021-01-16');
```

Result: 53025

## Question 4

```sql
select tip_amount, tpep_pickup_datetime 
from yellow_taxi_trips 
where 
  tpep_pickup_datetime between date('2021-01-01') and date('2021-01-31')
order by tip_amount desc 
limit 1;
```

Result: tip was 1140.44, on Jan. 20.

## Question 5

```sql
select "DOLocationID", count(*) 
from yellow_taxi_trips 
where 
  tpep_pickup_datetime between date('2021-01-14') and date('2021-01-15') 
group by "DOLocationID" 
order by count(*) desc 
limit 1;
```

Result: Location with id 236 (Name WIP) had 3004 drop-offs.

## Question 6

```sql
select "PULocationID","DOLocationID", avg(total_amount) 
from yellow_taxi_trips 
group by "PULocationID", "DOLocationID" 
order by avg(total_amount) desc 
limit 1;
```

Result: Locations with ID 4/256 cost 2292.4 in average.
