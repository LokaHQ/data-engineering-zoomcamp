## Question 1: Start date for the Yellow taxi data (1 point)

You'll need to parametrize the DAG for processing the yellow taxi data that
we created in the videos.

What should be the start date for this dag?

- **2019-01-01 TRUE, since the dataset starts on 2019 an we want to run for every month, we need to start on the first day of 2019**

- 2020-01-01
- 2021-01-01
- days_ago(1)

## Question 2: Frequency for the Yellow taxi data (1 point)

How often do we need to run this DAG?

- Daily
- Monthly, TRUE
- Yearly
- Once
